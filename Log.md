# Things I have learned 
I have learned many things about different operating systems (OS), open source softwares, coding misadventures,
and how obnoxious you can make some websites.

I learned that it is super easy to mess up in html and css. But not only that, 
but the fact that I can enjoy computer programming and feel safe in this classroom.

It is also very hard to not fall asleep in this class due to the lights being off and such, but I can have an enjoyable-
time doing something I actually like.

I am also hungry.
This isn't filler.

# Things I still want to learn.
I still would like to become better at learning all the different types of gaming-related subjects 
(since it's probably something I would consider doing later on in life.) 
I would also like to get a better grasp on CSS since the colour in my webpage has disappeared. 

I have also learned that I need to focus more and pay attention.

Also, that I need to balance my work.
